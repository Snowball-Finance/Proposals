This is a formal proposal for the pursuit of liquid staking as a Snowball branded, joint venture with external partners. With the current Q3 budget, Snowball does not have the resources to implement alone. However, this is an immediate need for additional products that can strengthen the Snowball community, expand the infrastructure on Avalanche and increase the attractiveness of staking on Avalanche. 

The business model for liquid staking can be pretty straight forward, take a percentage of the staking fees and a fee for the staked Avax. The business model most closely studying is LIDO on the ethereum network. https://twitter.com/FloodCapital/status/1387918459544145923?s=19

They are on track for $15 Million in revenues and expect to be around $30-50 million in the short term. While Avalanche is smaller and we can not expect these numbers day 1, we can be the early movers and capture a portion of the existing market of 206 million Avax staked. A 1% capture would be 2 million Avax with 10% of the rewards would be 20k Avax. This would be 300k in USD at the current price. The expected cost of getting this work off the ground with development of a trust minimizing design and audits is less than 200k. We expect this work to take less than 3 months. 

Therefore, we want to work with the community and potentially private investors to create a structure that would help us realize this work by leveraging the Snowball brand. 

To clarify, the proposal would to create a spin-off / joint venture that Snowball would have a direct interest. Some examples of potential execution would be to make the Snowball/xSNOB tokens directly redeemable for aspects of the liquid staking system, provide Snowball direct governance vote on the resulting product or use Snowball in some other relevant manner. 

This work is not meant to take away from existing work and buildout of the Snowball network, but add to it.
