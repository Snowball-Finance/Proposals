Sherpa Cash (https://sherpa.cash/)  recently completed its Trusted Ceremony to bring a robust privacy solution to Avalanche. Sherpa Cash is being built upon the fantastic work of Tornado Cash on Ethereum.  They provide the service of allowing users to leverage zero knowledge proofs (zkSNARKS) to securely mix funds to fresh wallets. This is an important measure to mitigate the risks to individuals and their purchasing habits. 

As part of bringing this work to fruition, Sherpa Cash wants to leverage existing ecosystem providers to distribute the governance tokens in an equitable manner.  There will be a total of 10 million Sherpa tokens minted over time. 2 Million will be initially distributed to ecosystem partners willing to participant in the initial purchase.

 To accomplish this goal, Sherpa has allocated 400k Sherpa tokens for Snowball. The current price is expected to be 15 cents per token. The treasury currently has about $250k in naked assets w/ of that value 90% in Snowballs. We also have approximately 50k in a diverse set of assets currently structured as Pangolin liquidity. 

There is a separate proposal from other investment proposals: a quarterly budget for development and an investment in liquid staking (70k-140k over approx 3 months). 

With these other financial considerations, I propose SNOWBALL purchases Sherpa Tokens with 40k in USD equivalent for distribution to xSNOB holders. 

Vote yes if you support this proposal.
